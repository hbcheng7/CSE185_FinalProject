# CSE185_FinalProject
We are making a tool to find peaks given transcription factor data. We will take an input of a tag directory of a certain input genome and a control genome for comparison, and then utilize an approach to estimate where the peaks are. 
Our output will be a .BED file written to the directory of the user's choice.
Tag directories MUST be generated prior to running our program, with tag files in the TSV format.
